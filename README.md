# What is WireMan?

WireMan is a terminal-based gRPC client with a user-friendly interface. It reads `.proto` files from a config file and keeps a history of requests.
WireMan is an ideal choice for developers testing gRPC endpoints directly from the terminal.

# Quick Start

If you prefer a quick overview, you can check out the official [website](https://preiter93.github.io/wireman).

Or follow the guide below.

## Prerequisites

- Rust: [Minimum required Rust version is 1.70] ([Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

## Installation

### Install with cargo

```
cargo install wireman
```

### Install with brew

```
brew install preiter93/wireman/wireman
```

### Download Binary

You can download the latest wireman binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/preiter93/wireman/releases).

### Install manually

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/preiter93/wireman.git
    ```

2. Build in release mode:

    ```bash
    cd wireman
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. Copy the binary to your PATH, e.g.:

    ```bash
    cp target/release/wireman /usr/local/bin
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can create an alias to the binary in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

    ```bash
    echo "alias wireman='CURRENT_DIRECTORY/target/release/wireman'" >> ~/.zshrc
    ```
## Demo

## Setup/Configuration

1. Set the `WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to specify the directory where your configuration file will be located:

    ```bash
    export WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/wireman
    ```
    
This step is **optional**. By default, wireman will be installed to `~/.config/wireman`.

2. Follow the setup steps:

    ```bash
    wireman init
    ```

3. The previous step creates a `wireman.toml` file in your configuration directory. Here's an example configuration:

    ```toml
    includes = [
        '$HOME/my-project/services',
        '$HOME/my-project/protos'
    ]
    
    files = [
        'order/api.proto',
        'price/api.proto'
    ]
    
    [server]
    default_address = "http://localhost:50051"
    default_auth_header = "Bearer $(getToken.sh)"
    
    [history]
    directory = "$WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR/history"  # Optional. Defaults to $WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR/history.
    autosave = true                            # Optional. Autosaves history on request. Defaults to true.
    disabled = false                           # Optional. History is enabled by default.
    
    [logging]
    directory = "$WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR"          # Optional. Defaults to $WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR.
    level = "Debug"                            # Optional. Defaults to Debug.
    
    # [ui]
    # skin = "$WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR/skins/dracula.toml"  # Optional. Set a UI theme.
    ```

    Replace with the appropriate values for your project.
    
4. At last, you can now verify the setup configuration
    ```bash
    wireman check 
    ```

## Usage

1. After adding the protos in the config, start `wireman`.

2. Basic key mappings are displayed in the footer of each page. For extended help, press `?` and close with `?` or `Esc`. If you want to close the app entirely, type `Ctrl+c`.
 
3. The first page of Wireman will list your grpc services and their methods. You can navigate with `up`/`down` or `j`/`k`, select with `Enter` or unselect with `Esc`, then click `Tab`.

4. The second page is the message screen. Edit your request message, you can format it with `Ctrl+f`. Then click tab. The navigation of the editor is vim-inspired: use `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` for motion, go into insert mode with `i`, and escape insert mode with `Esc`. For more details, refer to [edtui](https://github.com/preiter93/edtui).

5. The third page is the config screen where you can edit the address or metadata. Wireman allows for using bash scripts to get your tokens. Place the name of your script in the bearer token field, which must be in your PATH, between `$()`. For example, if you have a bash script named `getToken.sh` that prints the Bearer token `ey...`, you would use `$(getToken.sh)` (the script output should not include the word 'Bearer', as it is automatically added). Additional headers can be added with `Ctrl+a` and deleted with `Ctrl+d`. Go to the request page with Shift+Tab or click tab twice.

6. Now you can make the request by clicking Enter. You can save it with `Ctrl+s`. Saved requests are stored in spots 1 to 5. Switch to a spot by clicking the respective number. You can restore the default request with `Ctrl+d`, which deletes the history. You can also cancel a request with Esc. Switch between request and response with `J/K`.To copy the request or response click `Y`. Or follow step 6.

7. If you want to get the current request as a gRPCurl command, click `Ctrl+y` on the request tab, and it's copied to your clipboard.


## Command line flags

### Commands
- **`check`**  
  Runs a health check and displays configuration details.
  
- **`init`**  
  Sets up wireman by creating a default configuration file.

### Options
- **`-c, --config <CONFIG>`**  
  Specifies an optional path to a configuration file. If not provided, wireman uses the default configuration path.

- **`-l, --local-protos`**  
  Uses local protobuf files instead of the files and includes which specified in the configuration.

## Troubleshooting

Wireman logs important information and errors to assist in troubleshooting. By default, logs are stored in `$WIREMAN_CONFIG_DIR/wireman.log`.Make sure to check this log file if you encounter any unexpected behavior or errors while using the application.

If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/preiter93/wireman/issues).

## Custom Skins

Wireman allows users to customize the appearance of the UI by adding custom skins. To do this, simply specify the desired skin file in the `wireman.toml` file config:

```toml
[ui]
skin = "path_to_file/custom_skin.toml"
```
    
For a collection of pre-made themes, check out the [Wireman themes repository](https://github.com/preiter93/wireman/tree/main/wireman-theme/assets).

## Server Reflection

Wireman also supports server reflection of gRPC servers. To activate reflection mode, press `Ctrl + r` on the selection tab, enter the host along with optional authentication headers, and then press `Enter`. To switch back from reflection mode to file mode press `Ctrl + r` again.

## Server Side Streaming

Wireman supports server-side streaming. For example, if you have an endpoint like this:
```proto
rpc ListFeatures (ListFeaturesReq) returns (stream ListFeaturesResp) {}
```
Wireman automatically detects whether the endpoint is server-side streaming and handles it accordingly.
